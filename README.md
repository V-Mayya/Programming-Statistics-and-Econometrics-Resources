### Questions

<details close>
<summary><b>I don't see a lot of popular resources. Why?</b></summary>
<br>
- Still working on adding as many resources as I can when I have the time to (and find any new ones)
</details>

<details close>
<summary><b>Why these resources/areas in particular?</b></summary>
<br>
- The topics interest me and will help me keep track of my progress and learning as well. 
 <br>
- Having everything in one place makes it much easier to find resources when I need to without having to search all my saved/bookmarked resources (that's probably not organised well too!)
